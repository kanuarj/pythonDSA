# Intersection of two Sorted Linked Lists

# Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and return a new list representing the intersection of the two lists.
# The new list should be made with its own memory â€” the original lists should not be changed. 

# Example: 
# Input: 
# First linked list: 1->2->3->4->6
# Second linked list be 2->4->6->8, 
# Output: 2->4->6.
# The elements 2, 4, 6 are common in 
# both the list so they appear in the 
# intersection list. 

# Input: 
# First linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
# Second linked list be 2->3->4, 
# Output: 2->3->4
# The elements 2, 3, 4 are common in 
# both the list so they appear in the 
# intersection list.
