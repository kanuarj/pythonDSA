# Find whether an array is a subset of another array using Hashing :
# The idea is to insert all the elements of the first array in a HashSet, and then iterate on the second array and
# find if the element exists in the HashSet, if the HashSet doesnâ€™t contain any particular value then the second array
# is not the subset of the first array.

# Algorithm:
# Store the first array arr1[] in a HashSet.
# Look for the elements of arr2[] in the HashSet.
# If we encounter a particular value that is present in arr2[] but not in the HashSet, the code will terminate,
#     arr2[] can never be the subset of arr1[].
# Else arr2[] is the subset of arr1[].
