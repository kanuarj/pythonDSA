# Implementation of Stack using Arrays

# Advantages of array implementation:
# - Easy to implement.
# - Memory is saved as pointers are not involved.

# Disadvantages of array implementation:
# - It is not dynamic i.e., it doesnâ€™t grow and shrink depending on needs at runtime. 
#   [But in case of dynamic sized arrays like vector in C++, list in Python, ArrayList in Java, 
#       stacks can grow and shrink with array implementation as well].
# - The total size of the stack must be defined beforehand.

# Implementation of Stack using Linked List 

# Advantages of Linked List implementation:
# The linked list implementation of a stack can grow and shrink according to the needs at runtime.
# It is used in many virtual machines like JVM.

# Disadvantages of Linked List implementation:
# Requires extra memory due to the involvement of pointers.
# Random accessing is not possible in stack.
