# Move all zeroes to end of array

# Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zeroâ€™s of a given array to the end of the array.
# For example, if the given arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}.
# The order of all other elements should be same. Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1).

# Example: 
# Input :  arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0};
# Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0};

# Input : arr[]  = {1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6};
# Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0};

def pushZeroes (arr, n, count = 0):
    for i in range (n):
        if arr[i] is not 0:
            arr[count] = arr[i]
            count += 1

    while count < n:
        arr[count] = 0
        count += 1

# Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the size of elements of the input array.
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)
# ============================================================================================================
# Partitioning the array approach :
# The approach is pretty simple. We will use 0 as a pivot element and whenever we see a non zero element we will swap it with the pivot element. So all the non zero element will come at the beginning.
